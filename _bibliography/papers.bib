  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {Outlier detection is an important research topic in data mining and machine learning. However, existing unsupervised outlier detection methods suffer from irrelevant and redundant attributes in high-dimensional data, and their performance is also limited by their outlier detection models that rely on only one view. In this study, we propose a three-way decision-based co-detection model for unsupervised outlier detection. Specifically, we first improve the local outlier factor (LOF) method by introducing the Gaussian kernel function to make the measure of local reachability density more accurate. Then, we introduce fuzzy rough sets to perform attribute reduction, which further reduces the negative effect of irrelevant and redundant attributes on the measure of sample similarity. Finally, we develop a co-detection model that is trained on the original view and the transformed view generated by principal component analysis and uses the strategy of the three-way decision to collaboratively detect outliers. The results of comparative experiments on the selected UCI datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC-ROC index.}
