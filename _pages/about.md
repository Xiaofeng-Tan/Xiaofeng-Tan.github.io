I am a first year M.Sc student in the [PAttern Learning and Mining(PALM) Lab](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/) at the [Southeast University (SEU)](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) under the supervision of Prof. [Hongsong Wang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2022/0908/c23024a419407/page.htm). Now, I am a remote-interning student advised by Prof. [Pan Zhou](https://panzhous.github.io/recruitment/). My research interests mainly revolve around 3D/4D Computer Vision, and Multi-Modal Learning. 

In [Shenzhen Unversity (SZU)](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), I obtained my B.E and B.Sc in [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/) and [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.szu.edu.cn/), respectively. During my undergraduate, I did research under the supervision of Prof. [Can Gao](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=953).
