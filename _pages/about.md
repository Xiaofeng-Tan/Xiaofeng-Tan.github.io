I am a first-year M.Sc student in [PAttern Learning and Mining(PALM) Lab](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/) at [Southeast University (SEU)](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/). My research interests mainly revolve around 3D Human Modeling, 3D/4D Asset Generation, and Video Generation. 

Prior to that, I graduated with a dual bachelor‚Äôs degree from [Shenzhen University (SZU)](https://en.szu.edu.cn/): an honor B.E from [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering(CSSE)](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/) and B.Sc from [School of Mathematical Sciences(MS)](https://math.szu.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate, I conducted research under the supervision of Prof. [Can Gao](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=953).
