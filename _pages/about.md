I am a second-year M.Sc. student in the [PALM Lab](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/) (led by Prof. [Xin Geng](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/xgeng/index.html)) @ [Southeast University (SEU)](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) supervised by Prof. [Hongsong Wang](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/hongsongwang/main.htm), currently exploring new frontiers as a Research Intern at [Tencent's YouTu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open). Prior to that, I was a remote visiting student at [LV LAB](https://www.lv-lab.org/SMU/index.html) @ Singapore Management University (SMU), advised by Prof. [Pan Zhou](https://panzhous.github.io/).

My academic journey began at [Shenzhen University (SZU)](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), where I built a strong interdisciplinary foundation by earning a dual bachelor's degree. I graduated with an honors B.E. from the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering ([CSSE](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/)) and a B.Sc. from the School of Mathematical Sciences ([MS](https://math.szu.edu.cn/)). It was there, under the mentorship of [Prof. Can Gao](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=953), that I first delved into academic research.


My research interests mainly revolve around RLHF, RLVR, AIGC, and 3D Human Modeling. I am actively seeking **(1)** **research internships** at top-tier companies available after Mar. 2026, **(2)** **Ph.D. positions** for **Fall 2027** (preferably in **Hong Kong**, **Singapore**, or **America**), and **(3)** any research **collaborations**. Feel free to reach out via email, and I’d be happy to connect 😊. And if you’d like to talk about **Doraemon** 😺, that works too.
