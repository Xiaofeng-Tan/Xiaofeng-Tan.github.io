I am a first-year M.Sc student in [PAttern Learning and Mining(PALM) Lab](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/) at [Southeast University (SEU)](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) under the supervision of Prof. [Hongsong Wang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2022/0908/c23024a419407/page.htm). My research interests mainly revolve around 3D Human Modeling and 3D/4D Asset Generation. 

I earned my B.E from [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering(CSSE)](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/) and B.Sc from [School of Mathematical Sciences(MS)](https://math.szu.edu.cn/) at  [Shenzhen Unversity (SZU)](https://en.szu.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate, I conducted research under the supervision of Prof. [Can Gao](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=953).

If you have questions, feel free to reach out through [email (xiaofengtan@seu.edu.cn)](xiaofengtan@seu.edu.cn)!  Iâ€™m also happy to chat about anything related to Doraemon ðŸ¤£.
