I am a second-year M.Sc. student in the [PAttern Learning and Mining (PALM) Lab](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/) at [Southeast University (SEU)](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) supervised by Prof. Hongsong Wang, currently exploring new frontiers as a Research Intern at [Tencent's YouTu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open).

My academic journey began at [Shenzhen University (SZU)](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), where I built a strong interdisciplinary foundation by earning a dual bachelor's degree. I graduated with an honors B.E. from the [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE)](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/) and a B.Sc. from the [School of Mathematical Sciences (MS)](https://math.szu.edu.cn/). It was there, under the mentorship of [Prof. Can Gao](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=953), that I first delved into academic research.

My research interests mainly revolve around RLHF, Agentic RL, AIGC, and 3D Human Modeling. Feel free to reach out through [email (xiaofengtan@seu.edu.cn)](xiaofengtan@seu.edu.cn) for any questions!  Iâ€™m also happy to chat about anything related to Doraemon ðŸ¤£.
