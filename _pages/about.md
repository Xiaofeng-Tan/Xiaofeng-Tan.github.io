I am a second-year M.Sc. student in the [PALM Lab](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/) (led by Prof. [Xin Geng](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/xgeng/index.html)) @ [Southeast University (SEU)](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) supervised by Prof. [Hongsong Wang](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/hongsongwang/main.htm), currently exploring new frontiers as a Research Intern at [Tencent's YouTu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open). Prior to that, I was a remote visiting student at [LV LAB](https://www.lv-lab.org/SMU/index.html) @ Singapore Management University (SMU), advised by Prof. [Pan Zhou](https://panzhous.github.io/).

My academic journey began at [Shenzhen University (SZU)](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), where I built a strong interdisciplinary foundation by earning a dual bachelor's degree. I graduated with a B.E. from the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering ([CSSE](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/)) and a B.Sc. from the School of Mathematical Sciences ([MS](https://math.szu.edu.cn/)). It was there, under the mentorship of Prof. [Can Gao](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=953), that I first delved into academic research.

<div class="interest-card" markdown="0">
My research interests mainly revolve around RLHF, RLVR, AIGC, and 3D Human Modeling. I am actively seeking (1) <strong>research internships</strong> at top-tier companies available after Mar. 2026, (2) <strong>Ph.D. positions</strong> for Fall 2027 (preferably in America, Singapore, or Hong Kong SAR), and (3) other <strong>research collaborations</strong>. Feel free to reach out via 📧 <span class="copyable" onclick="copyToClipboard('xiaofengtan@seu.edu.cn', 'Email')">xiaofengtan@seu.edu.cn <i class="fas fa-copy"></i></span> or 💬 <span class="copyable" onclick="copyToClipboard('txf_06_20', 'WeChat ID')">WeChat: txf_06_20 <i class="fas fa-copy"></i></span>. I'd be happy to connect 😊. And if you'd like to talk about  <span class="doraemon-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon" target="_blank"><em>Doraemon</em></a></span> 😺, that works too.
